* Blockchain

** What?
#+begin_quotation
"A *shared*, programmable, cryptographically secure and therefore trusted ledger
*which no single user controls* and *which can be inspected by everyone*."

-- Klaus Schwab (Chairman World Economic Forum)
#+end_quotation

# Useful for cutting out trusted third parties, like banks, and other institutions
# professor Egbert-Jan Sol (on a recent blockchain meetup):
# “What robots did for the work force, blockchain will do for the office force.”

** Four pillars
- Cryptographic Tokens and Addresses
- P2P Networking
- Consensus Formation Algorithm
- Virtual Machine

# ** What is the blockchain?
# - Two kinds of *records*:
#   - Transactions
#   - Blocks: batches of *valid transactions* that are hashed and encoded into a *Merkle tree*
# - Each block includes the *hash* of the *prior* block in the blockchain, linking the two.
# - *Decentralized* (eliminate risk of data held centrally)
# - Every *node* or *miner* has whole copy
#   - No *centralized* "official" copy
# - Data is *incorruptible*
# - *Quality* by massive data *replication* and *computational trust*

** This.

# Bitcoin state: transactions of Bitcoin
# Ethereum state: transactions of Ether, STATE OF VM

** Consensus
- *Proof of Work (PoW)*: the current difficulty in the Bitcoin network requires
  miners to try quadrillions of times before finding a nonce that fits.
  (because *hashing* can provide vastly different outputs on minor changes)
- *Proof of stake (PoS)*: mining is done by stakeholders in the ecosystem who
  have the strongest incentives to be good stewards of the system. (E.g., by
  setting coins aside for a longer period as stake.)

* Smart Contracts

** Model

# Wanted to make a Rich Hickey joke related to OO, but it is not.
- Stateless webservices
- Contract-oriented programming
- Gas fees
# 1,5 million euro for a GB in March, lower gas price

** Stateless web services

#+ATTR_LATEX: width=\textwidth
[[file:../images/awslambda.png]]

# Correct: stateless web services

# IP -> address
# http request -> transaction
# security call-by-call
# Microservices Architectures

# Slow: waiting for blocks
# Pay gas

** Contract-oriented programming

#+begin_src javascript
contract HelloSayerFactory {

  function create() returns (address) {
    return address(new HelloSayer());
  }

  function delete(address addr){
    HelloSayer(addr).remove();
  }

}
#+end_src

** Tools
- geth: (Go Ethereum) *cli* for running full Ethereum node, exposes RPC
- web3.js: Ethereum compatible *JavaScript API* which implements the Generic *JSON RPC spec*
- solc: JavaScript bindings for Solidity compiler (creates *ABI* and *BIN*)

** MetaMask (also: Mist; Parity)

# - *Prompt user* when having to sign

* Fleet
** Why ClojureScript + blockchain
- *Blockchain*
- *ClojureScript*!
  - Reagent
  - Figwheel

** Idea
- Elisa Achterberg (Circle Economy and Sustainable Finance Lab) /et al./
# I hope this is roughly what she meant

** The idea

- *Linear economy* /designs for failure/ and sells *“almost-broken” products*,
  creating *waste*
- When they are used, *smart assets* (a *_fleet_* of assets) pay parties
  involved in value chain (involved with design, commodities, creation,
  maintenance, et cetera)
  - Shift */from ownership to use/* leads to *Circular Economy*
  - *A circular value network* in which materials and products are
    shared as well as risks and returns
# Always ask: who are the miners? Isn't there a trusted third party?
# *Why blockchain?* Automatic, verifiable, distributed contract, no trusted
# *third party

** Design
