* Blockchain
# Blockchain event
# ClojureScript meetup. Let met talk about it. Then I HAVE to build it

** Initial Coin Offering (ICO) announcement

# White paper
** Blockchain?
#+begin_quotation
"A *shared*, programmable, cryptographically secure and therefore trusted ledger
*which no single user controls* and *which can be inspected by everyone*."

-- Klaus Schwab (Chairman World Economic Forum)
#+end_quotation

#    Some more pillars
#  - Every *node* or *miner* has whole copy
#  - No *centralized* "official" copy
#  - Data is *incorruptible*
#  - *Quality* by massive data *replication* and *computational trust*

# Useful for cutting out trusted third parties, like banks, and other institutions
# professor Egbert-Jan Sol (on a recent blockchain meetup):
# “What robots did for the work force, blockchain will do for the office force.”

** Four pillars
- Cryptographic Tokens and Addresses
- P2P Networking
- Consensus Formation Algorithm
- Virtual Machine

** This.

# Bitcoin state: transactions of Bitcoin
# Ethereum state: transactions of Ether, STATE OF VM

** Consensus
- Proof of Work (*PoW*)
# the current difficulty in the Bitcoin network requires
#   miners to try quadrillions of times before finding a nonce that fits.
#   (because *hashing* can provide vastly different outputs on minor changes)
# Bitcoin energy as Ireland
- Proof of Stake (*PoS*)
# mining is done by stakeholders in the ecosystem who
#  have the strongest incentives to be good stewards of the system. (E.g., by
#  setting coins aside for a longer period as stake.)

* Smart Contracts

** Business logic in decentralized network
# Smart contracts put *business logic* in a *decentralized network*

** Model
# Wanted to make a Rich Hickey joke related to OO, but it is not.
- Stateless webservices
- Contract-oriented programming
- Gas fees

** Stateless webservices

# 1,5 million euro for a GB in March, lower gas price

** Stateless web services

#+ATTR_LATEX: width=\textwidth

# Correct: stateless web services

# IP -> address
# http request -> transaction
# security call-by-call
# Microservices Architectures

# Slow: waiting for blocks
# Pay gas

** Contract-oriented programming

#+begin_src javascript
contract HelloSayerFactory {

  function create() returns (address) {
    return address(new HelloSayer());
  }

  function delete(address addr){
    HelloSayer(addr).remove();
  }

}
#+end_src

** Tools
- geth: (Go Ethereum) *cli* for running full Ethereum node, exposes RPC
- web3.js: Ethereum compatible *JavaScript API* which implements the Generic *JSON RPC spec*
- solc: JavaScript bindings for Solidity compiler (creates *ABI* and *BIN*)

** MetaMask (also: Mist; Parity)

#+ATTR_LATEX: width=\textwidth

# - *Prompt user* when having to sign

#  Elisa Achterberg (Circle Economy and Sustainable Finance Lab) /et al./
# I hope this is roughly what she meant

** Linear economy designs for failure

# - *Linear economy* /designs for failure/ and sells *“almost-broken” products*,
#   creating *waste*

** Smart assets

- When they are used, *smart assets* (a *_fleet_* of assets) pay parties
  involved in value chain (involved with design, commodities, creation,
  maintenance, et cetera)

** Shift from ownership to use

#+ATTR_LATEX: width=\textwidth

Source: Circle Economy

  # - Shift */from ownership to use/* leads to *Circular Economy*
  # - *A circular value network* in which materials and products are
  #   shared as well as risks and returns

# Always ask: who are the miners? Isn't there a trusted third party?
# *Why blockchain?* Automatic, verifiable, distributed contract, no trusted
# *third party

** Contract design

** App design
- Reagent atom for *application state*:
  - Frontend state: (beneficiaries)
  - Blockchain state: Contract instance, abi and bin
  - Address of user
  - *queries.cljs* to interact with ratom
  - *views.cljs* reacts to its changes $v=f(S)$, or something

- *blockchain.cljs* /deploys/ or /retrieves/ contracts
  - Depending on network of web3 object (Ropsten or local)
- *smart\textunderscore{}asset\textunderscore{}manager.cljs* calls methods on instances
- Both use the *web3-cljs* web3.js wrapper

- Setup local blockchain for development with *fleet.el*
- TODO: *tests*..., *IPFS* deployment

* Fleet demo

# Local dev
# Connected to Testnet

# Structure
# Dev stuff: fleet-start, root, and web3
# db
# The actual contract
# Creation of ABI and BIN
# Initialization steps
# tests
